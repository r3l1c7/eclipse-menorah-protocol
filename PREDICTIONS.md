These predictions are published **in advance**.  If any fail within their windows, the protocol is **falsified**.

| # | Date(s)               | Event Forecast                                                                      | Window & Criteria                           |

| 2 | March 20 2027         | A high‑profile Jerusalem or temple‑mount incident coinciding with the spring equinox (1,260‑day marker). | Same date ±2 days; must reference "equinoctial" or numeric 1,260.

- **Prediction 2** fails if no equinox/Pentecost‑style Jerusalem incident is reported by March 22, 2027.
- **Prediction 3** fails if Wycliffe/Seed Company metrics do not show a notable missions surge around June 3, 2027.
- **Prediction 4** fails if no public “trumpet” proclamation or treaty emerges by October 8, 2030.
- **Prediction 5** fails if the November 25, 2030 solar eclipse passes without significant festival or public acknowledgment.
